\chapter{Background}
\section{Video Games}
Video games are a genre of digital games that has become extremely popular all over the world. There exist several different gaming consoles, and for each console there has been developed an endless amount of different games that meets almost every need and interest. Video games can be described as “electronic, interactive games known for their vibrant colors, sound effects, and complex graphics” \cite{videogamedef}. Hand held controllers or devices that capture movement are used to interact with the video game. The variety of video games makes it usable for many different purposes, like learning and education, exercising or just pure entertainment (veldig likt som oppgaven) \cite{project}. \\ \\
One might associate video games with children and teenagers, and many hours of game play, which partly is a right assumption to make. Video games are played for several hours every day, and it has taken a great part in people's everyday life. Gaming was usually associated with being anti-social, because of all the time used looked up in a room playing, but video games has emerged from sedentary, lonely gaming to gaming involving social interaction and movement. In USA in 2010, one fourth of all gamers were under the age of 18, but an interesting fact is that as much as 26 percent of the gamers are over 50 years old. This shows that not only children and teenagers uses video games, a great share of elderly has started to use this type of technology. In Norway,  as much as 8 percent of the population in the age range from 45 - 79 use computer or video games every day \cite{project}. Elderly contributes to a great share of the world's population, and if the entertainment industry could see this group as potential customers, it would open up a new and inexperienced market for video games \cite{ijsselsteijn2007digital}. 
\section{Serious Video Games}
The widespread and assorted use of video games has made a great potential for the entertainment industry with regard to development of new games, but also in terms of developing games for additional purposes beside pure entertainment. A new way to use video games is for different types of training, education and learning, which is called serious video games. Serious video games can be described as “a mental contest, played with a computer in accordance with specific rules, that uses entertainment to further government or corporate training, education, health, public policy, and strategic communication objectives.” \cite{zyda2005visual} The idea is to use the fun, motivating and captivating features that video games possess and combine it with pedagogy. Which video games to be defines as serious video games depends on how the game is used, the purpose of the game and the users gaming experience. 


The term serious video games is not something new, it has existed for many years, and it was introduced by Clark Abt in 1968 [kilde]. The idea of serious games started in 1950 with research on non-electronic board games,  but it did not break through when it first was introduced in the 1990s. The failure that time was that the focus of the game was on learning, which resulted in boring games with no market success \cite{susi2007serious}. Michael Zyda states that, in serious video games, pedagogy has to be subordinate (SAMME ord som i teksten) to the story and entertainment component of the game. It is important that fun and entertainment is the main focus in the game \cite{zyda2005visual}. 


There exist several genres of serious video games, where game-based learning, simulation games, games with a purpose, games for health and exergames are some of them. Serious video games also provide the opportunity to experience real-life situations and adventures one may otherwise not be able to enjoy. This might be due to expenses, time, distance, or physical capabilities. With serious video games it is possible to play golf, be the star of a boxing match, paddle down turbulent rivers, and explore nature and creatures one have never seen before. In a more serious matter, video games can be used to simulate brain surgery or a battle in a war zone. This can teach students how to perform medical procedures or it could prepare soldiers for war. Serious video games can also be used for students to learn their curriculum through quiz games, and people can be motivated to work out with exercise games. Serious video games can be used in several situations, and for purposes, and it can help people develop a huge number of different skills. \\ \\
Research on use of serious video games shows positive evolvement of skills and knowledge, and positive effect on health, which results in motivation for further research and development. (VET ikke om dette er rett ord å bruke). In addition, the new technology involving physical interfaces and improvement on graphics and animations initiates to new types of games. The market for serious video games are inexperienced and unexplored, so there are a great potential for further research \cite{alfingewang}. Market sales the last couple of years also shows promise for serious video games in the future. In 2008, the market for serious games sold for around 1,5 billion USD around the globe \cite{alfingewang}, and in 2010 it reached about 2 billion USD (1,5 billion EUR). The market is expecting a annual growth rate of 47 percent, up to about 13,5 billion USD (10 billion EUR) in 2015! \cite{idate} \\ \\
We will look deeper into one of the genres of serious games, exergames.  
\section{Exergames}
Exercise games, or exergames, is a type of serious video games that combines the traditional game play with physical activity. The combination of required movement and amusement is used to stimulate exercise and engage people to be more physically active in a more fun and motivating way. Much research has been done in the area of exergames, and results show that exergames can have a positive effect on users health. In addition to being a new, fun and different way to work out, exergames provide an opportunity for social interaction. A great amount of today’s existing computer and video games possess this feature, and as much as 78 percent of all gamers say they play with others either in-person or online. One of the two top-selling video games in 2011 was Just Dance 3, which is an exergame that has the possibility to play with others \cite{statistics2012}. This shows that the social aspect of gaming is important for the players. The social aspect these games provide may also be especially important for people who experience loneliness in their everyday life \cite{project}.\\ \\
Exergames uses technology like remote hand held controllers and motion sensors which capture body movement. Users are therefore required to get up and move their body to be able to play the game. There exist several consoles that support this technology, where Nintendo Wii, Playstation Move, Dance Dance Revolution and Xbox Kinect are some of them. The existing consoles uses different type of devices to capture body movement, like hand held controllers, different boards and pads with embedded sensors, and video cameras with motion sensors. In this assignment we will focus on the Kinect sensor technology.
