\section{The Menu}

In this section we will present a proposal for a menu. The reason for doing this is based on observed problems in workshop 1 related to menus in existing video games, and also our own experience from playing. The menu presented is a prototype developed with Microsoft PowerPoint.

The general perception of the menus was that they were complex, difficult to follow, demanding to navigate through, and that they were too sensitive. 

The design of our menu proposal is based upon feedback from workshop 1, and theory about designing interfaces for elderly. Simple design, distinct elements, and easy to read information is emphasised to make it user-friendly for elderly that might suffer from declined vision. 

We can take a look at Figure \ref{fig:velgSpill} to observe the different menu elements.
