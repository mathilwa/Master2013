\section{Discussion of Findings from Workshop 1}

In Section 6.1. we discussed the importance of usability which is about how easy a system is to use, learn and understand. Workshop 1 was performed to see how a set of relevant users interacted with existing commercial exergames, and to identify what aspects of these games work and do not work. \cite{usabilitydef} states three relevant elements that can say something about a system's usability: \emph{effectiveness}, \emph{efficiency}  and \emph{satisfaction}. These were aspects among others that we tried to measure in the workshop. We also tried to answer the concept \emph{context of use}. We wanted to discover the needs of the games' intended users, the needs for the functionality and the environment for the game. Where and in what circumstances the game can be used, was discussed in our previous project assignment \cite{project}. This is not our main focus in this thesis, but will briefly be discussed in Chapter \ref{subsec:whatwhere} 

In this section, we will discuss the findings from workshop 1 and relate these findings to the literature provided in precious chapters. In workshop 1, and in our literature study we have tried to answer these research questions: 

\emph{RQ1: Are existing commercial Xbox Kinect games suitable for exercising purpose for the senior user group?}

\emph{RQ2: What are the design challenges when developing video games aimed for exercising for the senior user group?}

First, we will provide a general discussion, and then we will summarize by more precisely answer the two questions at the end of this section. 

\subsection{Control of Character, Clear Goals and Feedback}
In the Game Flow model \cite{sweetser} discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:heur}. eight core elements that should be present to experience enjoyment in games are described. Of these eight core elements we found a lack of three of the elements in the commercial games tested in workshop 1. The informants expressed that they did not feel that they had control over their character. This was due to the significant delay that was present in the games. In addition it came clear from the observation that it was not always easy to understand when the game started and ended, as well as what was an instruction video and what was the actual game. The element clear goals did also seem to lack in the commercial games, and it was expressed by one of the informants that there was a need for more instructions on what was actually expected from them and the rules of the game. The last element the informants were not satisfied with was the feedback. Also two of the eight golden \cite{mmi} rules presented in Chapter \ref{subsec:golden} discuss the importance of getting informative feedback at appropriate time. The informants desired more feedback on their actions, and they especially wanted to know whether they did the exercises right or wrong. They did not feel that they got this feedback in the games played in the workshop, which made them both confused and frustrated at times. Clear goals, appropriate instruction, information and feedback, are aspects highly considered in the new game concept. The delay problematic will be discussed in more detail in Section \ref{sec:delay}.
 
\subsection{Immersion and Concentration}
As presented in the GameFlow model \cite{sweetser} immersion and concentration are important aspects of the gaming experience. It was hard to evaluate from observing and interviewing informants if they were immersed into the game and concentrated on the tasks. However, comments like \emph{"I felt like the person [avatar] itself"}, and cheerful comments given by the informants while they played, like \emph{"I wanted that pineapple"}, suggested that the informants immersed into the game. If we are to evaluate, we would say that all the games required concentration to perform the tasks right. However, it did not always seem like the informants were that concentrated. One example of this is that sometimes we had to assist in reading the messages appearing on the screen, like "raise hand above head to play", while they read the same type of messages themselves at other times. We believe that the text should have been clear enough, and that the reason for them not reading the text, was because they were not concentrated enough on the game. 

\subsection{The Possibility to Customise}
As mentioned, in our previous project \cite{project} we evaluated the game to fit as a tool that physiotherapists can use as an alternative exercise method for their patients. The value proposition of this game we described as: \emph{"A tool with the ability to customize an exercise program, and to offer an alternative, fun and motivating training method, while at the same time ease the workload of the physiotherapist"} \cite{project}. In this thesis we have focused on one part, of this description: \emph{an alternative, fun and motivating training method}. For this game to meet these three criteria, the end-users had to be included in the development process. However, as learned from \cite{Billis}, \cite{gregor}, \cite{gerling1}, as well as from the informants, there is a need to customise these kind of games and acknowledge elderly's various limitations and disabilities. One example given by the informants was that the skiing game could have too fast pace for some people within this user group, and that it could cause problems for people with decline in their balance function. The possibility to customize the games can for example be a feature in the physiotherapists interface, where they can put together different exercises within the game story, that fits their patient. Another example is for the user herself to have an interface where she can put together her own program.  As can be found in Table \ref{tab:func2} in Chapter \ref{sec:req} we have made additional requirements for this, but we have limited our thesis to not prototype a user-interface for this. 

\subsection{Aspects to Meet Player Enjoyment}
In Chapter \ref{sec:motivators} we discussed self-efficacy as an important determinant of exercise behaviour. Elements that are relevant to sustain this exercise behaviour are the feeling of pleasure and satisfaction, and self-regulatory skills. This was also discussed in workshop 1 as important aspects, and the informants mentioned goal setting, the possibility for socialising, and the possibility to self decide what to do, as important. The feeling of mastery was seen as significant. They were clear that if they did not get the feeling of mastery, they would not play these games. This relates to the elements discussed in the Game Flow model \cite{sweetser}, where some of the criteria for player enjoyment in games are to include challenges that match the player's skill level, to have different levels of challenges, and clear goals. In addition, the Game Flow model says that games should support social interaction. Also in Chapter \ref{sec:exergames} the importance of social interaction in exergames are discussed, and  as much as 62 percent of all gamers say they play with others \cite{statistics2012}. Several previous studies \cite{Billis}, \cite{gerling2}, \cite{gerling1} discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:summaryguidelines} also stress the importance of the social factors of a game. Offering social interaction, can especially be important for elderly who experience loneliness in their everyday life, due to inactivity \cite{project}. It was interesting to learn that social interaction also was seen as important by the informants. The majority of the informants would rather play together than alone. However, none of the informants could see themselves playing together with others over the internet. This relates to the findings done in \cite{Gajadhar} where it was shown that elderly enjoyed playing together in the same room more than playing online. We also believe that one of the reasons for the informants stating this was because they did not understand the concept of "playing over the internet", as a result of their inexperience with this kind of technology as discussed in Chapter \ref{subsec:characteristics}. This might indicate that the market is too immature for this. When it comes to social interaction, one of the informants meant it was more motivating to cooperate than compete. This was also found in \cite{Gajadhar} where they in line with the result from their study and from previous studies conclude that the focus should be on cooperative play rather than competition for this group of people. 

The informants' opinions did not differ much according to gender on what they liked and did not like in the games we tested. However, as discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:motivators} different people's needs and expectations, as well as aspects such as gender and ethnicity should be considered. We will meet this by making a concept with a series of games that covers a variety of interests, as well as getting to choose a man character or a woman character. Race might also be considered, but it is difficult to cover all races. Chao et al. \cite{chao} discuss that to meet these requirements it is important to be in contact with the relevant people. Even though we clearly have not covered the total group of elderly, we have included a small group to understand some needs and expectations. In Chapter \ref{sec:sergames} we discussed how video games can function as a pedagogical tool and it was shown that important factors to focus on includes motivation, effectiveness and intuitiveness. Another aspect discussed in the same chapter is behaviourism, which states that if someone is rewarded for something he or she is likely to repeat the action that triggered the reward KILDE. These aspects were also mentioned by the informants, who stated that the system needs to be easy to understand, and that the feeling of mastery and that you learn something are important.  One informant mentioned that if they did not manage to do something, they would stop doing it. In our game concept we will focus on emphasising the goals in the game, and the player will be rewarded with points. In addition we provide different levels. This will be done in two ways: Different initial difficulty levels the player can choose between, and different difficulty levels within the initial levels, where the next level depends on the previous.  

\subsection{Appropriate and Simple Feedback and Information}
In Chapter \ref{sec:summaryguidelines} we listed typical characteristics of elderly based on findings from the literature. In our research we had a group of informants, who were relatively physically and mentally fit. From the list provided in Chapter \ref{sec:summaryguidelines} we only experiences three out of the nine characteristics. We experienced that one of the informants had problems reading the text in some of the menus. Because there was only one informant that seemed to have problems with this, we assume that this informant might have had impaired vision. However, it is important to acknowledge that impaired vision is a common problem for the older population as discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:summaryguidelines}, and in Chapter \ref{sec:designelderly}, and it should therefore be considered in a game designed for this group. The group of informants had interest in technology and used different types of technology, like computer, tablets, mobile phones, e-mail, e-banking, TV, etc. However, none of the informants had any experience with video games. In the beginning of the workshop we experienced that some of the informants were insecure, and had problems understanding what they were suppose to do. It took some time for most of them to understand that they had to use their body to play. Therefore, we see a need for clearer instructions both before and under game play. This includes an introduction to how the system works, like how to interact with the sensor. The last of the characteristics listed in Chapter \ref{sec:summaryguidelines}  we experienced, was that some of the informants expressed that it was hard to do more than one thing at the same time. Therefore, the information given, and the tasks to be done, should be limited, and adjustable. The possibility to add more functionality after the existing functionalities are managed was suggested by one informant. This is also listed as one of the guidelines in Chapter \ref{sec:summaryguidelines}, and suits well with the requirements of simplicity discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:simplicity}. 

In Chapter \ref{sec:summaryguidelines} we presented a set of previous studies and provided a summary of some important aspects that can serve as guidelines when developing games for elderly. One of these guidelines suggested in \cite{Billis} and \cite{gerling1} is about giving motivating feedback. Some of the games that were played in workshop 1 had a lot of different features that were suppose to be motivating. However, by some of the informants this was rather seen as annoying.  In addition the amount of the information given, both text and audio, was experienced as too much. At the same time, some of the informants stated that they did not recognize these type of messages at all. In Chapter \ref{sec:simplicity} we discuss minimalistic design which is about bringing the most important elements into focus, without elements that will distract the user. Microsoft presents it as "Simple Can Be Powerful", which means that simplistic design not necessarily needs to mean lack of functionality. From this we conclude that we should avoid too much features in our video game concept. We should keep it simple, and focus on a few motivating aspects. One of the informants desired more time to read information and instructions, and suggested that there should be a way to tell the system when you are finished reading. This is also a requirement suggested in \cite{w3cTekst} which we have included in the guidelines for making user-friendly interfaces for elderly in Chapter \ref{sec:designelderly}, and will be taken into account in our game concept. 

\subsection{Cultural and Lifestyle Diversity}
Another guideline discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:summaryguidelines}, and the second of the eight golden rules presented in Chapter \ref{subsec:golden}, are about matching cultural and lifestyle diversity in the games. This was expressed by the informants as important, and they suggested different type of themes for a possible game concept, like dance, swimming, apple picking etc.. If they were to play a game like this they stated that it would need to include sports or activities related to real life. They also mentioned the importance of appropriate music. They did not like the music in the commercial games because they were not the type of music they used to listen to. Using appropriate music was also discussed in Chapter \ref{sec:motivators}, and \cite{schutzer} sees music also as a way to divert from pain coming from the exercises. The majority of the informants agreed that music was important, especially to keep the rhythm. However, they stated that they wanted it quite, and they wanted music more related to their generation. This is an important requirement we will set for the exergame, however, it is without our profession to say anything specific about what music to include. 

\subsection{Summary}
We will now provide a summary of the discussion to in a more precise way answer research questions 1 and 2. 

\emph{RQ1: Are existing commercial Xbox Kinect games suitable for exercising purpose for the senior user group?}

As mentioned initially, effectiveness, efficiency  and satisfaction are relevant measurements when evaluating the usability of systems. From findings done in workshop 1 we can conclude the following about the commercial games tested: 
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\bullet$}
\item The existing commercial games tested on a group of elderly do not meet the requirements of effectiveness. The games do not spend enough time on instructions and information, and do not give sufficient feedback on what the players are doing is right. The menus are too complicated and it is too many elements showing at the same time. The buttons presented in the games are too sensitive, and it is not intuitive how to press the buttons. 
\item The existing games meet only to a degree the requirement of efficiency. In FruitNinja it was clear that the informants did not understand what was required from them, and they just waved their hands uncontrollably. The majority of the the informants understood what was expected from them in the tennis game, and played through this game without problems. The skiing game was also well understood, until the second match where the two players that played together switched tracks. All of the informants had problems relating to their player after switching tracks. None of the menus met the requirements of efficiency. We had to assist the informants through the menus, and because of too much information and too sensitive buttons, the informants spend unnecessary time on getting through the menus.
\item Two of the four games played in workshop 1 meet the requirement of satisfaction. All of the informants liked playing the tennis and skiing game and they had fun while playing. FruitNinja, they did not like that much, which relates to their wish for playing games with a meaningful content that they could relate to everyday life, which is not the case for FruitNinja. The informants were not satisfied with the personal trainer game either, because this focused on "just" regular training, which they would rather do without the game. This strengthens up under Michael Zyda's statement on that the main focus in serious games should be fun and entertainment \cite{zyda2005visual}. 
\end{itemize}

It is important to mention that this was the first time the informants played games like these, and initially they did only play the games once \footnote{Three of the informants got to play the skiing game a second time because they specifically asked for it. We did not observe anything new in this second session, and have because of this, and because the rest of the informants did not try a second time, not included this in our analysis}, which did not enable us to say anything about the informants learning curve. However, we did see that they understood more what was expected from them, and that they got more confident after a while. If we had went on with several rounds with the same games, we might have seen improvements. This was also mentioned by the informants. 

\emph{RQ2: What are the design challenges when developing video games aimed for exercising for the senior user group?}

It is important that we acknowledge the difficulties about engaging a user group into a setting they are completely unfamiliar with. It is hard to evaluate some users needs, when they do not even know about these needs themselves. We have learned from workshop 1 and from our previous project that today's elderly are not necessarily the right user group for a game like this, but that the next generation of elderly are more suitable. However, it is hard to test a tool that is meant as an alternative form for exercising on people who are physically in good shape, and who keep one doing regular exercising. 

The game should meet all the requirements in the GameFlow model \cite{sweetser} presented in Chapter \ref{sec:heur}. We found this model to serve as good guidelines, as many of them was mentioned as important aspects by the informants, and also because there is a clear relation between these guidelines and the guidelines we can draw out from the literature, presented in the previous chapters. Specifically the informants desired a game with a story that appeals and relates to real life, as well as appropriate music to their age. It was urged for more instructions on how to interact with the game, as well as what was expected from the players, the goals, and the rewards. The menus in the commercial games were seen as challenging because of the amount of information and the sensitive buttons. In a game for this user group this needs to be improved. The majority of the informants would only play these type of games together with others. In \cite{chao}, \cite{statistics2012}, \cite{Billis}, \cite{gerling2} and \cite{gerling1} social aspects are also discussed to be important, as well as it is a recommended guideline in the Game Flow model \cite{sweetser}. Therefore, it is important to include this in our game concept. The delay in the games was seen as a big problem, and should be acknowledged.  This is a technical issue that we are not in the position to evaluate the reason for. We believe that if this game is to be used for exercising, both at home and in clinical settings, technical precision have to be present. 

\section{Discussion of Findings from Workshop 2}
In Section \ref{sec:userinvolvement} we presented how important user involvement is during system development, as the end-user are the ones who will use the final product, and are the only ones who know what they want. After making a concept based on theory, previous studies, and findings from workshop 1, we wanted to invite elderly to a second workshop to get feedback on our ideas and design proposals. In workshop 2 we presented our prototypes for a exergame concept for elderly, and we had questions and discussions during the presentation. Figure \ref{userdesign}, from ISO 13407, is a cycle of four steps for user centered design, where workshop 2 is about the fourth step, evaluating system design. Involving the end-user in the design process will increase the possibility of making a user-friendly interface for the intended user group, which is stated in Section \ref{sec:usability} as crucial for making a successful system. Feedback from workshop 2 will be discussed, and we will present important aspects to be included in the future work of designing an exergame for elderly. These aspects will just be discussed, we will not make any changes to our current exergame concept, as this is out of the scope of this thesis.

In addition to discussing findings from workshop, and relating them to theory provided in previous chapters, we will try to answer this research question:
 
\emph{RQ4: Is it possible in an early development phase to involve a user group that is inexperienced with the type of technology being developed?}

We will start by a general discussion, and then try to answer this research question in the summary of this section. 

\subsection{Difficulty Levels}

Mostly, the informants liked the exergame concept we presented for them, but there were some concerns and uncertainties about integrating quizzes in the trail. The GameFlow model, presented in Section \ref{sec:heur}, consist of eight core elements, where concentration is one of these elements. Here, the importance of not distracting players from tasks the want or need to concentrate on, is emphasised. In addition, players should not be bothered with tasks they sees as important. The informants expressed concerns about having quizzes together with physical tasks, as they felt that might draw attention away from one of them. They did not like the idea of doing two thing as the same time. This would be important to take into consideration when developing an exergame for elderly, as it is a fact that this group of people have difficulties doing more than one thing at the same time \cite{bruin}. This was mentioned when showing prototypes, where the players were suppose to do some kind of task, and at the same time collecting hearts and answering questions. We suggest that one solution for future work could be to choose, when starting up the game, whether you want to include the cognitive challenges or not. From the Challenge element in the GameFlow model we know that games should offer difficulty levels that matches the player's skills. This, combined with the Concentration element, has lead to the idea of adjusting frequency between the appearance of obstacles and number of simultaneous tasks will be according to the various difficulty levels. The difficulty of required exercises and movement should also be controlled by the difficulty level, as this is an important feature for elderly that might suffer from various physical challenges \cite{gregor}, \cite{gerling1}. Some challenges, like balancing over a log, was mentioned as a bit challenging. One informant stated that she though she would feel dizzy, and that she was afraid of falling (in real-life). This challenge was also reviewed by a physiotherapist (NINA). She stated that it was a difficult exercise to perform, and therefore should be included in higher levels in the game. This support the importance of providing the possibility for players to choose difficulty levels themselves \cite{gregor}, \cite{gerling1}. However, the GameFlow model emphasises that the game also should support adjustment of difficult level after the player's skills and progress. By offering both these opportunities in this exergame, we meet the feedback from the informants, as they want to be able to master the various tasks, and not be forced into something they would not master. They both wanted to choose themselves, and to let the game follow their increased skills. 

\subsection{Graphics, Sounds and Interface}

As mentioned in GameFlow theory, immersion is an important aspect for the player to effortless be involved in the game \cite{sweetser}. In workshop 2 the informants expressed that the concept with the nature trail was good idea because they felt like they were familiar with the environment. This supports findings from previous studies, like in \cite{gerling2}, where the participants appreciated the use of a real-life environment.  

The summary guidelines presented in Section \ref{subsec:guidelines} emphasises that an interface should be simple and not to complex, and that important elements should be brought into focus. The informants seemed to like and understand the menu interface we presented for them. Their general perception of the interface was that is was \emph{"beautiful"}. The back-button and the purpose of it was observed and understood immediately. A comment was to highlight the buttons even more, making them stand out more with a hint of shadow around them. SilverPromenade, presented in Section [EGENTLIG ANNEN REFERANSE] \ref{chap:exforseniors}, had success with an intuitive and user-friendly interface, which quickly and easily guided the users to game play. As mentioned in \ref{sec:menu}, we have a longer menu to include the possibility to choose actions, and at the same time avoid too much information at each step. The informants feedback was that they felt the menu was OK, but that they wanted to use shortcuts when they had got familiar with the game. Inclusion of shortcuts for the experienced user is mentioned as an important feature in the second of the Eight Golden Rules, presented in \ref{subsec:golden}.

From \cite{schutzer} and Section \ref{sec:georep}, we know that sound and music is an important part of the players enjoyment and gaming experience. We did not present any music, or soundtrack, for the elderly, as this, as mentioned in Section \ref{sec:outinthenature}, is out of our competence area. However, we told the informants that we wanted to use calm and peaceful music, like classical music. This to meet their feedback from workshop 1, where there was too much noise. We also presented the informants for ambient effects, like birdsong and sound of running water, as this are sound related to the environment of the game, and sound effects like a "ping" when collecting a heart. They seemed OK with this music and sound, but they wanted something with rhythm to more easily immerse into the game and exercise. Future work would therefore be to find appropriate music for the nature trail and the single games, based on the exercise and pace in each game. 

Generally, there were a lot of questions related to game play and the various elements in the prototypes. This was questions on what the hearts meant, and what would happen if they touched them. That the hearts was observed quickly is positive, as they are important elements of the game. This means that they stand out, which is stated as important in Section \ref{sec:designelderly} and \ref{subsec:guidelines}. In the same sections, intuitive interfaces is important. What is not so positive with all the questions, is that it states that our interfaces are not that intuitive as we had believed. This has to be taken into consideration for future work. Two elements in the menu were a source to a lot of discussion due to lack of intuitiveness and consistency. One of these was the menu step where the player were to choose environment and difficulty level. This especially yield the understanding of the increased difficulty level between the three environments. It came clear to us that it was not very intuitive that the three different forests we presented in the menu were meant as three different difficulty levels. Future work would be to focus on including textual information to make this part more intuitive. A suggestion would also be to have instructions on what the different difficulty level means. The other menu step was where the player had chosen to play according to a specific muscle group. The informants did not see consistency between the term "muscle group" and what we presented in the menu. I1 said \emph{"Yes, muscle group, it does not fit with what you show here [refers to the picture of the menu where the player can choose different type of muscle groups]"}. This is not positive for our interface, as consistency is mentioned in the first of the Eight Golden Rules. We acknowledge that we had not thought through this step in the menu thoroughly. However, we concluded that this is future work for professionals, like a physiotherapist, to do, and that what we presented was just an example. As we saw from the findings from workshop 2, the informants had questions about what would happen if they were to fall down from the log and into the river. Similar technical issues could include the possibility to walk outside the path and into the forest. These kind of limitations that have to be programmed into the game, are aspect we have not considered in our concept. However, it is something that needs to be looked further into and integrated into the system requirements.   

\subsection{Few Comments and Moderate Response}
As mentioned, there were a lot of questions from the informants, but what was more common during workshop 2 was that there was no comments at all. When we presented the various prototypes, the informants responded with silently nodding or just looking mutely at the screen. There could be several reasons for this. One reason could be because of the informants lack of experience with this type of technology and video games in general. This makes it difficult to comment on a video game concept, as they do not know what to look for and respond to. One of the informants stated that it was impossible for her to say something about our exergame concept, as she did not know anything about how the game would work. Another reason could be related to how we presented our prototypes. The exergame we have made a concept for is based on highly interactive video game technology, and as presented in \ref{sec:prototypes}, it is therefore very difficult to make good prototypes for. In addition, we did not made the prototypes in a way where it was possible for the informants to interact with the prototypes. We presented the prototypes with the "Wizard of Oz", with the informants observing. The lack of interaction between the informants and the prototype could have lead to poor understanding of how the game would work. A question from one informant supports this assumption. She asked if the girl in the prototype would respond to her movements, even though she had played games like this before. A final reason could be that we did not present the information good enough. After the question from the informant about the avatar, we explained how it worked, and it seemed that the informants understood quickly. This increased understanding lead to more questions and feedback. Also, when I4 described the quiz as she would like to have it, this was the same the way we had imagined it to be. It seemed that we did not present this clear enough, as there was never meant to be the way in which they would have to answer a question at the same time as they were balancing over the log, like I4 thought.   

\subsection{Summary}
We will now provide a summary of discussion of findings from workshop 2, where we will draw important aspects to consider in the future work of the development of an exergame for elderly. We will also try to answer research question 4.

\textbf{Future Work for an Exergame for Elderly}
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\bullet$}
\item Future work should include working on how to present the idea of difficulty levels for the users. There was a lot of questions and confusion related to what each difficulty level implies, and also how the difficulty levels are chosen. When we explained how it would work, and the informants liked the idea, but this did not came clear from our prototyped concept. Future work should focus on including instructions and information about how the difficulty level is chosen and controlled. In addition, textual information should be included in the menu step where the player is to choose environment, to indicate that each environment holds different difficulty levels.  
\item Our prototypes showed obstacles, hearts and quiz icons all in the same picture. We presented it this way to show how elements will appear along the way in the nature trail, but the informants did not see the depth in the picture, and believed that they should do everything at the same time. The elements shown all together also made the prototype appear as distracting, as the informants did not know what to focus on. Future work should include studying the presentation of elements. A suggestion would be to let the elements appear when the player reach a certain distance, to avoid having to much elements on the screen at the same time.
\item In future work, the exergame should hold the possibility to separate the quiz from the nature trail. This should be done to let the player more easily focus on one task at the time. It might be more natural to include the quiz when the player has gotten more familiar with the game.
\item Future work should focus on how the quizzes should work, and how and when they will appear. How we presented the prototypes, made the informants believe that they should answer quizzes while doing something else. I4 presented how she would like the quizzes to be, answering questions separate from other tasks, and this is the same way that we had imagined it to be. We clearly did not present this element good enough. This shows the need for a thorough introduction to how the quizzes will work. Future work could also include looking into presenting the quiz icons in a different way, to not take focus away from the current tasks. 
\item The buttons in the menu should be highlighted to let them stand more out. This can be done by adding some shadow around the buttons.
\item It should be the future work for professionals to find appropriate music to the game. This yield ambient effects that fit the environment, sound effects to give users feedback on actions (like when collecting a heart), and music suitable for the intensity in the game. Maybe calm and peaceful music suits the walk in the forest, while music with more rhythm fits the picking apple game. 
\item It is important to include the purpose of all important elements in the instruction video. There was a lot of questions about the hearts and their purpose, and we presented earlier that this could be a result of lack of intuitiveness. To our defence, the idea was that the purpose of the hearts should be presented in an instruction, but this was not included in our presentation. We observed how the lack of instruction created confusion, and we therefore see the importance of having these instructions.  
\item It should be the future work for professionals, like physiotherapists, to find out which muscle groups to present as choices when the player wants to play according to a specific muscle group. Our lack of knowledge in this area shone through when we presented this part, as the informants quickly commented the lack of consistency between the term "muscle group" and what we had presented as muscle groups to choose from. 
\end{itemize}

\emph{RQ4: Is it possible in an early development phase to involve a user group that is inexperienced with the type of technology being developed?}

We found it difficult to include such an inexperienced user group in an early development phase. This it not based on the fact that development is in an early stage, but that the elderly are very inexperienced and unfamiliar with the video game technology Kinect provides. The elderly did not know what to look for or respond to when prototypes was shown to them, as they could not relate to what we presented. During workshop 2, we did not get much feedback on our prototypes. This could also be a result of our presentation of prototypes. It was difficult to make interactive prototypes for such a complex and interactive system. We know from Section \ref{sec:prototypes}, that how users interact with the prototype is crucial for understanding the system. It was not possible for the informants to interact with our prototypes, which might have lead to lack of understanding. It was not easy for the inexperienced informants to come with feedback on such an interactive system, when they were presented for still pictures, even though they had played Kinect games in workshop 1. We believe that a more interactive prototype would have lead to more understanding and that it would have triggered more feedback. However, we did not have time or knowledge to develop an interactive prototype. 
 

\section{The Delay Problem}
\label{sec:delay}
Both in workshop 1 and workshop 2, there was a lot of time spent discussing and commenting technical aspects related to the delay between the player and the avatar on the screen. This problem was a source to much confusion and frustration, and is did not give the informants a real-time experience. It is important to take this into consideration when developing a new game, since the delay destroyed part of the enjoyment for game play. Control is another one of the core elements in the GameFlow model \cite{sweetser}, and a part of this is about the player being in control of their characters and movements. Feedback from the two workshops was that the informants did not felt this control, due to the delay [SITAT].

\section{Miscellaneous Aspects to Consider About the Exergame Concept}
\label{sec:misc}

\subsection{Discussion on where and in what circumstances the game can be used}
\label{subsec:whatwhere}

In this our previous project \cite{project} we evaluated the game to have the most potential in a clinical setting, offered as a training method at physiotherapy clinics. This was based on two main things. First, "Samhandlingsreformen" encourage the use of welfare technology where possible in health care. Second, most elderly, who are the end-users have little or no experience with video games, which will make it hard to reach out to these customers. In this thesis we have not focused on where the game should be implemented. However, we did ask the informants where they could see the game be used and two main settings were mentioned: in a group setting, for example in nursing homes, and in a setting with grandchildren. We decided to not study any further where the game can be implemented. This was both because we experienced that the majority of the informants had a hard time picturing themselves own and use a game like this, and also because from what we learned from the interviews conducted in our previous project, where physiotherapists could not say anything about whether they would use this game or not before they could test the actual game. For more discussion around where the game could fit, we will direct the reader to \cite{project}, and in particular Chapter 8.2 and 9 in that report. 

In Chapter \ref{sec:barriers} we discussed some challenges when it comes to motivating elderly to exercise. Some of these challenges were also mentioned by the informants. One informant saw it as a barrier to exercise if she lived far away from the training centres, and could see that the game could have a potential as a replacement for going to the gym. Another informant did not want to get controlled by time and appointments, which suggest that an exergame could be an alternative way to exercise on their own time.

\section{Discussion of Quality of the Gathered Information}
\label{sec:discQuality}

Section \ref{sec:qualityresearch} states the importance of evaluating the quality of the research we have done. This can be done by looking into three criteria, \emph{reliability}, \emph{validity} and \emph{generalizability}. We will now discuss each criteria up against our work in this thesis. In addition to this, we will discuss some possible pitfalls that we might have experienced during our qualitative research.  

\subsection{Reliability}
In our thesis we have worked on separating our own findings from qualitative research, from theory and previous studies conducted by others. Our findings are presented in chapters separate from theory and literature, see Chapter \ref{chap:findW1} and \ref{chap:findW2}. In these chapters, our own opinions and theory are not included. These chapters only emphasise feedback and opinions from the informants, where feedback are written as summary of discussion, or as direct citation. Findings from the qualitative research are related to relevant theory when presenting our concept, see Chapter \ref{chap:concept}, and in our discussion presented in this chapter.

How we have chosen informants for our qualitative research is important for the quality of our study. \cite{gregor} also states the importance of using representative users during the development process. Our informants are all members of "Seniornett", and are as mentioned, very committed to learning technology. All of them already uses a wide range of technology devices, as mobile devices, tablets, and computers. Most of the informants have a high education, and they are relatively active in their everyday life. Five out of seven informants stated that they are active in the means of exercise, while the two others mentioned that they are active due to everyday tasks. We will state these informants as fit older people. The informants average age was 70.6 years (with a standard deviation of 7,9 years). We feel that these informants are representative for our qualitative research based on their age span, however, they might not be completely representative for the users this exergame is meant for. This exergame is meant for frail older people that has a reduction in functionality, which may make them inactive due to regular exercise. This is people that do not go to the gym or participate in training groups, which makes them in the need of a tool that can motivate them to exercise. [ER DETTE BARE TULL??]. However, this exergame would be a good tool for our informants when they experience decline in functionality, and no longer have the ability to attend training groups or the gym. The informants chosen for our qualitative research is also more experienced with technology than most elderly in the same age group. [KILDE??].  

Our role in this workshop might have affected the reliability of our findings. What is preferred is that our participation would have been neutral, but that was not the case. We participated in the workshop by informing about the technology, showing how the different games would work, we guided the informants when needed, and we partly participated in the discussion. This might have influenced the feedback from the informants. In addition, in workshop 2, we presented a design and concept that we had made. We wished for a valuable brainstorming around the concept, and urged the informants to come with both positive and critical comments. The informants were polite, and where mostly positive what we presented. I1 said \emph{"No, it is nothing negative"} about our concept. The fact that we presented our own concept, may have lead to the informants being afraid of hurting our feelings by saying what they actually meant.

Our choice of games that we presented for the informants was not a coincidence. Each game were chosen for a reason, which can be read in Section \ref{sec:chosengames}, and we wanted to trig different reactions. This could have affected the outcome of our qualitative research. Choosing different games might have changed the findings from our research.  

\subsection{Validity}

In our discussion we have related findings from the qualitative research with theory and previous studies within the same subject. What we see is that our findings supports what is found in this related theory and findings. We did not experience much deviation in our findings from findings in previous studies. The only aspect we can comment on, is clear interest, and questions from the informants, related to various technical aspects. We will therefore state that our findings are valid and of relevance to the study's purpose. 

We had some difficulties placing our qualitative research method within a specific research method. We have therefore, in Chapter \ref{chap:metode}, discussed several research methods we have touched into. We used this discussion to describe and substantiate which methods we have used in our qualitative research. We have also explained the reason for choosing the various methods. We feel that our discussion is thorough, and that it strengthen the validity of the information gathered.

\subsection{Generalizability}    
Our focus in this thesis has been to develop an exergame concept for elderly. We have used our theory, literature, and findings from qualitative research, in addition to knowledge about elderly and exercise, to specify system requirements for this exergame. Our concept is based on these requirements, and it consist of a specific story with various challenges and exercises. However, we feel that these system requirements it so general, that it could be used as guidelines for others who want to develop a video games for elderly. The system requirements could also be used for other cases than the one we have studied. About generalizability, Section \ref{sec:qualityresearch} mentions three types, naturalistic, moderate, and conceptual. We have, based on this discussion, chosen conceptual generalizability as relevant for our thesis.    

\subsection{General?}
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\bullet$}
\item The informants assumptions of what the workshop would involve could have affected the outcome of the workshop. 
\item Workshop 1 was held over two days, but it was not executed exactly equal the two days. One day the informants got a little more instruction and guidance than the next day, some informants got to play longer than others, not all the same questions were asked during the discussion. All this can have affected the findings from this workshop. 
\item User involvement is about involving users from the start to the end of the system development process. We only included the informants two times in the development process, to discover their needs and opinions, and to evaluate our design. Basically, due to the theory of user centered design the informants should have been more involved. However, this was not done due to time constraints in this master thesis, and due to the informants inexperience with technology. 
\item The second workshop we involved an informant that did not participate in workshop one. She participated in this workshop, with no experience on the Kinect technology, except what we presented during our first meeting with "Seniornett". She was therefore not able to provide us with much feedback.

\section{General stuff}
- Diskusjon av gjennomføring av workshop
- Guidelines/tips til nestemann

\section{Discussion of Our Video Game Concept}
- Hva med å ha diskusjon og presentasjon i samme? Ref maja og william young
- Diskusjon av brukergruppen
- Diskusjon av brukergrensesnitt for eldre. Brukergrensenitt for fysioterapeut - ikke med (?)
- Si at vi har fokusert på eldre bruker, at det ville krevd en helt annen brukergruppe å ha workshop med om det skulle lages brukergrensesnitt for fysioterapeuten sin side.
- Vise fram tre menybilder, der vi har diskutert farge på knapp og tekst. 
- Viktigheten av inkludere valg for muskelgrupper. Alle spill har jo introklipp til hva som trenes, men da må man først gå helt inn til spillet for å vite "utbyttet" av treningen.
