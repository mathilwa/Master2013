\chapter{Introduction}

The world's population is ageing, in addition to people living longer. This together with baby boomers has led to a great share of older people in the world. In 2007, 20 percent of the population in the developed world was over the age of 60 \cite{dickinson2007methods}, and it is expected that 25 percent of the population in Europe will be over the age of 60 by 2020 \cite{ijsselsteijn2007digital}. A problem with such a great share of elderly in the world, is that it will be difficult to provide health care services to everyone that might need help, due to physical and psychological decline. Cognitive impairments, decreased mobility functions, and visual and auditory decline are common problems related to ageing and the older population. One common problem for this group of people is increased risk of falling, due to reduced balance and physical strength. This is an important problem to take into consideration, as falls are one of the main factors when it comes to loss of function, independence and quality of life for elderly [Ganske likst som kilden (smartsenior)]. The main focus should be to make the older population healthier, so that they can experience greater quality of life, where strong health is the key to achieve this. In Norway, a goal for the older population, is to offer everyone that needs it, a place in care homes by 2015. If this is to be possible, something has to change.     

Use of technology for different purposes has become an important part of peoples' everyday life. One of these purposes, is use of video game technology to enhance people in physical activity. Exercise is an important aspect in slowing down older peoples ageing effects, as decline in mobility, balance and physical strength. The introduction of an exergame could be part of the solution of getting an healthier older population. The Norwegian "Samhandlingsreformen" supports this solution, by including welfare technology in the health sector where possible. However, many older people do not use technology as computers, mobile phones, tablets, and maybe especially video games, as it is very unfamiliar to them. In addition, most technology developed today are aimed towards younger user group, and are therefore not suitable for elderly. A first step to make the older population accept the use of video games for health related purposes, would be to develop a game aimed especially for their needs and interest, where their physical and psychological declines are taken into consideration. 

Based on this we will in this thesis focus on gathering sufficient knowledge and information to design a video game concept, with special focus on elderly and exercise.    

\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:researchq}
Physical decline is one of the disabilities elderly face while growing older. It is possible to slow down this process by introducing physical activity. Exergames have shown promise in health related purposes like exercise and rehabilitation. However, previous research have found that commercial exergames are not suitable for elderly, as they are not specially aimed and developed for this user group. 

In this thesis, we will study how elderly interact with commercial video games to see what do and do not work, and to validate previous findings. With this we will answer research question 1 and 2: 

RQ1 \emph{Are existing commercial Xbox Kinect games suitable for exercising purpose for the senior user group?} 
RQ2 \emph{What are the design challenges when developing video games aimed for exercising for the senior user group?}

Based on theory and knowledge about video game development, in addition to findings from our study, we will try to answer research question 3:

RQ3 \emph{What would be suitable system requirements, and appropriate design, for a video game concept for the senior user group?}

\section{Contribution}
Our contribution in this thesis has been to develop a design for an exergame concept aimed at the elderly users. We have used aspects from our previous project assignment as motivation for our work, which are summarised in Chapter \ref{chap:background}. To be able to understand the elderly users, we have looked into which challenges we might meet when it comes to elderly and exercise. We will also discuss typical motivational factors for getting older people to exercise. This will be presented in Chapter \ref{chap:olderexercise}. We have studied important aspects related to game developed for the older user, as we will be discussed in Chapter \ref{chap:exforseniors} and \ref{sec:designelderly}. To get a thorough basis for our exergame concept, we have summarised a set of guidelines from related literature, studied video game theory and system design in general. This can be found respectively in Section \ref{sec:summaryguidelines}, Chapter \ref{chap:vg} and Chapter \ref{chap:generalsystemdesign}. In accordance with the importance of user involvement, we have conducted two workshops where we have engaged users in the development of the exergame concept. We recruited informants for our workshops by holding a presentation for "Seniornett", an organisation working with learning the older population technology. This will be described in Section \ref{sec:recruitment}. Our presentation can be found in Appendix XXX. Workshop 1 was conducted to observe and understand how elderly would interact with commercial Xbox Kinect games. In this workshop methods like questionnaire, participatory observation and focus group interviews were used. These are described in \ref{chap:metode}. We let them play games, and followed with a focus group interview. A more detailed description of the execution, and findings from workshop 1, will be presented in Section \ref{sec:ws1} and \ref{chap:findW1}, respectively. The main focus for this thesis have been to specify system requirements and create design for a concept for an exergame for elderly. This work has been based upon information gathered from theory, previous studies and findings from workshop 1. The design was presented by making prototypes. The exergame concept is the most important contribution in this thesis, and will be presented in Chapter \ref{chap:concept}. The concept was brought to a second workshop, to be evaluated by the users. Execution of and findings from workshop 2 are presented in Section \ref{sec:ws2} and Chapter \ref{chap:findW2}. In our discussion we suggest a detailed description of future work for an exergame for elderly, based upon findings from workshop 2. This thesis provides general guidelines for how to design an exergame for elderly. The concept presented can serve as a foundation and starting point for developing an exergame for elderly.     

\section{Scope and Limitations}
Initially, we worked in collaboration with a company who was going to develop an exergame for elderly. Our work in this collaboration was to come up with a concept for their game. They were suppose to provide us with a library of exercises that are shown to be good for elderly, and that the game was meant to be build around. Unfortunately, this collaboration ended two months into the work period, which slowed down our progress.  One important limitation of our thesis was the sample of informants in our workshops. Elderly can not be seen as one common group of people. They are people with different interests and needs. In this thesis, we only included one small group of elderly. As the first workshop was critical for our further work, we did not have much time recruiting informants. Therefore, we recruited only informants from the organization "Seniornett", where all have one common interest for technology. We recruited informants through a presentation we held at one of their meetings in Trondheim. This gave us a small number of informants. Due to the time limit, we did not use more arenas for recruiting. The informants had never played video games before, which made it challenging to include them in the development process of our exergame concept. Putting a group of elderly in setting playing the different Kinect games, is not a natural setting. This made it difficult to fit this study into defined research methodologies. The last limitation concerns the choice of how to present our design. We used prototypes, but limited them to not involve any interaction, even though they represented scenarios for a highly interactive game.
