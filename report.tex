\chapter*{Preface}
This thesis is written as a part of our master's degree in Communication Technology, with focus in Tele-economics, at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The focus of this thesis has been to design a video game concept for elderly, and it is a continuation of work done in our project assignment. 

We would like to thank our professor Lill Kristiansen for valuable guidance and feedback on our work during this final semester. The result of this thesis would not have been the same without her ideas and comments. We would also like to thank supervisor Ather Nawaz for stepping in when we needed him the most. His help has been highly appreciated the few final weeks before handing in the master thesis.  

"Seniornett" deserve a great thank you for their contribution to our assignment. This, especially, yields Arne Sølvberg, the manager of "Seniornett" in Trondheim. He has helped us a lot with arrangement of meeting, booking of facilities, moving needed equipment, and engaging elderly to join our workshops. We would not have been able to perform these workshops without his help. We are also grateful to the eight seniors from "Serniornett" who had time and willingness to participate in our workshops. Their feedback and opinions have been used as part of the basis for our master thesis. We would also thank Pål Sæther from the Department of Telematics for always helping us finding the equipment we would need. The main findings in out thesis was presented in a workshop with the FARSEEING EU-project, and we would like to thank the participants in this workshop for their appreciation of our study. [DETTE VET VI JO IKKE HELT ENNÅ]       

Finally, we would thank our families for all the support we have got during all our time as students. We are forever grateful! And to all our classmates and friends, thank you for all the fun and good memories! The time here at NTNU has been unforgettable. And to each other, a thank you for a great semester. We finally made it!
