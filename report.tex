\begin{abstract}

The aim of this study is to identify important aspects for an exergame for elderly, and based on this, specify system requirements and develop a concept for an exergame. Due to "baby boomers" and the fact that people live longer, the share of older people in the world is growing. One common problem elderly people face is reduced balance function and physical strength, which increase the risk of falling for this group. Engaging elderly in physical activity can help overcome this problem. However, this can be challenging. Today, there is a great focus on the use of technology for health related purposes, including using video games with motion sensor technology to promote physical activity. These types of games are called exercise games, or exergames, because they require the player to use body movements to play. The Microsoft Kinect sensor is a console that has shown promise as a tool for use in clinical practice. In a previous project we evaluated exergames used as a tool in physical therapy. Apparently, customised games are required for the elderly population. The commercial exergames that exist are made for a younger user group, and many games are not suitable for the older population. It is important to identify aspects of exergames for elderly for making valuable games for them. In this master thesis we have developed a concept for an exergame for elderly people. Research on relevant topics has been conducted, to find important aspect for the game. We have looked into guidelines for how elderly should exercise, as well as motivating factors for exercising in general. We have studied related research, identifying different characteristics of elderly, as well as proposing guidelines on how to develop and design exergames for this group. In addition, official guidelines proposed by three different organizations on how to design user-friendly interfaces for elderly are provided. In the development of an exergame for elderly, usability and simplistic design become significant. Meeting this, the relevant users have to be involved in the development process. We have included a group of elderly in one iteration of the cycle of user-centered design. This was done by arranging two workshops. The first included an experiment, where a group of elderly people got to play three different commercial Xbox Kinect games. During the gaming session, we observed how they interacted with the games, what did and did not work, and how they seemed to like the games. A focus group interview was performed after the gaming session. From workshop 1 we learned that the group liked playing the games, but that there were important aspects that could be improved, such as more instruction and feedback, easier menus, more information about what was expected from them, which body parts that were exercised, and whether they did the exercises correctly or not. There was a desire for activities that could be related to real life, with appropriate music. Clear goals and the feeling of mastery were seen as important. Based on the findings from workshop 1 and the research on relevant topics, system requirements have been proposed and a design for an exergame concept has been developed. The exergame includes one compounded game, exercising the whole body, and four single games, exercising specific muscle groups. The games are made with relevant exercises in a familiar environment. Early stage prototypes were made to visually show what different scenarios in the games will look like. In addition, a menu proposal was provided. To include the users, and to get feedback on the concept, a second workshop was held. The exergame concept was presented by showing prototypes, simulating gameplay and explaining scenarios. Focus group discussions were held, to get feedback on the exergame. The overall perception was positive, however, some aspects of the games were unclear, and some suggestions for improving the games were made. We conclude that existing commercial Xbox Kinect games contain some elements not suitable for the elderly user, and that they lack certain functionality. However, the games that contained real life activities were experienced as fun. The proposed system requirements are appropriate for this user group, and the exergame concept was appreciated. However, some adjustments should be made in the future work on the exergame. We acknowledge that the group of users involved was physically and mentally fit, and that their opinions and experiences may differ from another group with other characteristics.

\chapter*{Preface}
This thesis is written as a part of our master's degree in Communication Technology, with focus in Tele-economics, at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). The focus of this thesis has been to design a video game concept for elderly, and it is a continuation of the work done in our project assignment. 

We would like to thank our professor Lill Kristiansen for valuable guidance and feedback on our work during this final semester. The result of this thesis would not have been the same without her ideas and comments. We would also like to thank Post Doc Ather Nawaz and Professor Leif Arne Rønningen for stepping in the last couple of weeks before submission. Their help has been highly appreciated.  

"Seniornett" deserve a great thank you for their contribution to our assignment. This, especially, yields Arne Sølvberg, the manager of "Seniornett" in Trondheim. He has helped us a lot with arrangement of meeting, booking of facilities, moving needed equipment, and engaging elderly to join our workshops. We would not have been able to perform these workshops without his help. We are grateful to the eight seniors from "Serniornett" who had time and willingness to participate in our workshops. Their feedback and opinions have been used as part of the basis for our master thesis. We would also thank Pål Sæther from the Department of Telematics for always helping us finding the equipment we would need. The main findings in out thesis was presented in a workshop with the FARSEEING EU-project, and we would like to thank the participants in this workshop for their appreciation of our study. 

Finally, we would thank our families for all the support we have got during all our time as students. We are forever grateful! And to all our classmates and friends, thank you for all the fun and good memories! The time here at NTNU has been unforgettable. And to each other, a thank you for a great semester. We finally made it!
