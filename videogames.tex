\chapter{Characteristics of Video Games}
Game designer Sid Meier came up with one of the most famous definitions of a game: “A game is a series of interesting choices” \cite{understandingvg}. This of course, does not apply for every video game. In \cite{understandingvg} the authors present the MDA-model, which was developed by Robin Hunicke, Marc LeBlanc and Robert Zubeck, after several workshops conducted at the "Game Developers Conference" in California between 2001 and 2004. This model divides games into three elements: \emph{mechanics}, \emph{dynamics}, and \emph{aesthetics}, and is a very useful tool for designers to understanding games. \emph{Mechanics} are not something we can see or hear, but rather the rules and basic code of the game. It is for example the algorithms that lies in the ground for creating the reaction pattern of a computer-controlled character. \emph{Dynamics} are based on the mechanics and describes what events do and can occur during the gameplay, seen from the players point of view. \emph{Aesthetics} say something about the emotions triggered when interacting with the game. A list of elements  that attract us to games is provided in the book "Understanding Videogames" (directly drawn from \cite{understandingvg}): 

- Sensation (game as sense-pleasure)\\
- Fantasy (game as make-believe)\\
- Narrative (game as drama)\\
- Challenge (game as obstacle course)\\
- Fellowship (game as social framework)\\
- Discovery (game as uncharted territory)\\
- Expression (game as self-discovery)\\
- Submission (game as pastime).\\
One or more of these can be included in a game, but usually not all of them.

We will not discuss \emph{aesthetics}, in more detail, as this is the most important entity in this thesis. 

\section{Aesthetics}
The aesthetics describes everything that can be experienced by the player. These are the elements that actually makes the game. The aesthetics can be divided in three, namely rules, geography and representation, and number of players. The rules say something about what the players can and cannot do, as well as what actions will make the score increase or decrease. The geography and representation element says something about how the video game is represented through graphics and sound. Here there are a lot of different design possibilities. The number of players is important, because there are huge differences between a single-player game and a multi-player game \cite{understandingvg}. We will come back to this in section 6.1.3. 

We will now look a little closer into the three categories rules, geography and representation, and number of players.

\subsection{Rules}
In \cite{understandingvg}, they distinguish between two types of rules; interplay rules and evaluation rules. The former are the physical laws. It determines what properties the different elements in the game should have, what can be done, as well as what will happen corresponding to the player input. An example of this is "What will happen when the player presses button A? Jump". The latter defines what rewarding and punishments will be given at certain actions \cite{understandingvg}. 

\subsection{Geography and representation}
Geography and representation is about how the game is represented through graphics and sound \cite{understandingvg}. Graphics and sounds are used to set the games environment and enhance the players enjoyment of the game, but has no effect on how the game is played. Graphics is needed in a videogame to in a best possible way imitate reality and enhance the player experience. This means that instead of telling out what is happening, it will be shown visually. Sound is important in video games for the same reasons as why graphics is important. Background music can set the atmosphere of the game, as well as give an indication on when actions will change and if the atmosphere is changing (for example from happy to sad). Sound can also be used as feedback to the player \cite{umlapproach}. There are different types of sound included in a  video game. \cite{understandingvg} distinguish between four categories:
\emph{vocalization}, which is the game’s characters’ voices,
\emph{sound effects}, which are sounds made by the different objects in the game, \emph{ambient effects}, which is non-specific sounds that makes the atmosphere in the game, and \emph{music}, which is the game’s soundtrack, but also a part of setting the atmosphere. The latter is a very important part of the game. Other elements that can affect sound effects are \emph{the environment}, \emph{spatiality} and \emph{physics}. What kind of environment the player is in can affect the  sounds. An example of this, is what kind of floor the characters are walking on or what kind of weather conditions there are in the scene. The sound will also be affected by where in space it will come from. For example, a sound from far away sounds different from a sound close up. In addition, sound will be affected by movements. Imagine the sound of the sirens on an fast passing ambulance.

There are many things to consider when it comes to how the game should be represented. See Table \ref{tab:graphic} for an overview of basic geographical and representational characteristics. We will only discuss the choice of perspective, dimension and exploration in this thesis. 

\begin{table}
\centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
        \hline
       \textbf{Perspective} & First person & Third person & &  \\ \hline
       \textbf{Dimension} & 2 & 3 & & \\ \hline
       \textbf{Space type} & Torus & Abstract & Free & \\ \hline
	   \textbf{Off-screen} & Dynamic & Static & None & \\ \hline
	   \textbf{Scroll} & Vertical & Horizontal & Free & None \\ \hline
	   \textbf{Exploration} & Forced & Free & None & \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption[Graphical Characteristics]{Basic graphical game characteristics \cite{understandingvg}.}
    \label{tab:graphic}
\end{table} 

It has to be decided if the game will be two-dimensional or three-dimensional and in first-person or third-person. Two-dimensional graphics are represented by only two coordinates and does not have any depth. This makes a very unrealistic scene. Three-dimensional graphics, on the other hand, has depth, and is therefore much more realistic. Every game will either have a first-person perspective, a third-person perspective, or a mix of both. In a first-person perspective, the game is played through the characters eyes, while in a third-person perspective the player can see the character he controls through the game. Games will also either have an isometric perspective or a top-down perspective. Isometric perspective is when three-dimensional objects are presented in a two-dimensional form, like in a architectural drawing, while a top-down perspective is, as the name suggest, when the scene is shown from above. The choice of perspective is important because it decides how the player will perceive the game world. It is also important to choose the right perspective with the right dimension. A third-person game can be played in a two-dimensional and a three-dimensional space, while a first-person game should only be played in a three-dimensional space. Exploration say something about whether the player can move in the game at forced or desired pace \cite{understandingvg}. Another aspect experiences by the player is time. It is proposed to distinguish between play time and event time, where the former is the time a player uses playing the game, and the latter is the time in the game world. If play time and event time are the same, we can say that the game is played in real time. In many games it is possible to save the game, and return to the same state at a later time \cite{understandingvg}.

There are many different ways to present a game graphically, and Aki Järvinen defined three different styles common for video games. \\ 
\emph{Photorealism:} "a style of painting that tried to completely mimic photographs". There are two subcategories of photorealism: \\
Televisualism tries to give the same visual look as shown on the television. Typical for this, can be for example football games. Illusionism is the other category. Here it is used photorealistic graphics in the service of non-realistic content (siste setning skrevet av. skjønte ikke helt). \\
\emph{Caricaturism:} Here so called caricatures are used. Caricatures are drawings that presents an object by exaggerating the prominent features of the object, and often gives the feeling of a cartoon. \\
\emph{Abstractionism:} In this category there are no real people or real-life objects involved. Instead  the game has a rather abstract form. An example of this is the well known game Tetris. A problem with these kind of games is that they often face a hard time on the market. This is because humans mostly get attracted by the story, and it can therefore be hard to create attention just around the mechanics of the game. Therefore, it is within this category very important with the story \cite{understandingvg}. 

\subsection{Number of players}
The number of players is an important choice because it affects a number of game elements. In a single-player game artificial intelligence (AI) is important, because the player has to play against the computer and not real humans. The computer can never be as intelligent as the human brain, and generally employ a very limited set of strategies. Therefore, it can be easy for an experienced player to win over the opponent. When designing multi-player games, artificial intelligence is not needed, as the player will play against other human players. These games faces other issues instead. For example it has be possible to distinguish between characters. This can be done by giving them different unique features, but at the same avoid making any character superior. It is also important to facilitate social interaction between the players, like for example cooperation or competition \cite{understandingvg}. Often in multi-player games, it is possible to chat with the opponents or team members.

\section{Story}
One important element of a videogame is the story, or the narrative. The story is included in the game to make the involvement and enjoyment better for the player. The story is just a part of the game, and is not the game \cite{umlapproach}.  Different events make up the narrative and will usually contain settings and characters \cite{understandingvg}. Unlike literature and film, which centers on the story, the game centers on play. Therefore, the narrative should be looked at in a player-centric context \cite{gametheory}. The game designer is kind of creating the story together with the audience. This is because the player often make their own story throughout the game \cite{umlapproach}. This means that the game designer creates the background storyline, while the player creates the experimental story while interacting with the game or others. 

In \cite{understandingvg} they introduce interesting elements of narrative in video game, and discuss three different categories: "The fictional world: settings and actors", "Mechanics: organizing narrative action", and "Reception: the player’s experience of story".

\subsection{The fictional world}
This category includes settings and actors, which can also be thought of as the \emph{who} and \emph{what}. The game space, which is the game setting, is on of the most important parts of a game. The game space is a reproduction of some of the features of the real world and contains specific rules to make it possible to play the game. There are different characters in a game, and they are very important for the story. This includes not only the characters that the game is about, but also characters that make things happen and that interacts with the main characters. Therefore, all the different characters need to be considered. \cite{understandingvg} propose four different categories of characters: 

\emph{Stage Characters:} These characters can not be interacted with, and serve more as just a part of a scenario. \\
\emph{Functional Characters:} These are also just a part of a scenario, but in addition, they have a general function, which makes it possible for the player to interact with them in some way. \\
\emph{Cast Characters:} These have specific functions in the game that has something to do with the story. \\
\emph{Player Characters:} These are the characters that the player is in control of. 

The different characters can be constructed in different ways. They can be constructed through description, which means through the way we can see them on the screen. This can be done in a symbolic, naturalistic or a "real-life" way. See Table \ref{tab:description} for examples.

\begin{table}
\centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Type of description} & \textbf{Example} \\ \hline
       symbolic & red haired girl is diabolic  \\ \hline
       naturalistic & villains are ugly, while heroes are good-looking \\ \hline
       real-life & David Beckham as a football player \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption[Different ways to describe characters]{Different ways to describe characters \cite{understandingvg}.}
    \label{tab:description}
\end{table} 

The characters can also be described through their actions, through their relationship to space, through other character’s views, or just through a meaningful name. The player character is the most important type, and was by Toby Gard divided in three different categories, in accordance to how easy the player will identify with them. The different categories are avatars, actors and roleplaying, and are defined as:

“Avatars are a non-intrusive representation of ourselves, actors are always part of a story (or have a story, albeit minimal sometimes), and roleplaying characters have very different abilities that we can raise according to our performance”. \cite{understandingvg} 

With the use of avatars the game is in first-person and can therefore not be seen, while actors usually will be seen in third-person. In addition, actors will usually have a personality and they are well integrated in the story, while an avatar usually do not have a personality at all. Roleplayers are quite different. Here the player create their own characters. The player can choose their name, and their abilities, as well as if they want to play in first-person or third-person.  

\subsection{Mechanics}
This category describes how to organize narrative action. There is a basic concept for how to organize the story in a game, which is called "branching". This means to have multiple paths in the story. 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{linearFiction}
\caption[Classical linear fiction]{A model of classical linear fiction \cite{understandingvg}}
\label{fig:linearfiction}
\end{center}
\end{figure} 
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{interactiveFiction}
\caption[Interactive fiction]{A model of interactive fiction \cite{understandingvg}}
\label{fig:interactivefiction}
\end{center}
\end{figure} 

Figure \ref{fig:linearfiction} shows the standard progression of a story of linear fiction. In traditional stories, it goes through a resolution. This can not be applied in a game, because it would not let the player do anything. Therefore, a model of interactive fiction is applied for a game. As you can see from Figure \ref{fig:interactivefiction}, this model has no continuous curve. In this model it is more about finishing each chapter by solving puzzles, and it relies on the emotional satisfaction the players get from the victory of solving a puzzle. Even though an action in a game can lead to different endings, the player is actually solving a story. These games are called progression games because the player has to finish different actions, before proceeding. The different chapters are cumulative, meaning that each chapter are building on each other. It is very common in these kind of games that it is a climax or a resolution at the end of each chapter (in many games you have to fight "the boss"). These kind of games are called \emph{progression games}. 

The other structure of narratives, is \emph{emergence games}. This structure depends on a more active artificial intelligence where all the objects in the game has behaviours (Example directly drawn from the book: "In a progression game, the dragon will always attack the player when she steps into the cave, but in an emergence game, this might depend on how the player behaves towards the dragon, which is a more "active" object with a few possible different responses." The two game designers Smith and Juul means that an emergent structure is preferable in games. This is because this structure gives the player more freedom. To be able to easily explore the smaller events in a game, game designers are making so called "quests", which is the mission the players have to perform in the game. When the different quests are defined, it can be put together and be told as a story. In \cite{understandingvg} they say that "ideally, quests are the glue where world, rules and themes come together in a meaningful way". Quests can be seen differently from the designer perspective and the player perspective: The designers look at quests as "a set of parameters in the game world (making use of the game’s rules and gameplay) that creates a challenge for the player.", while the players look at the quests as "a set of specific instructions for action". 

\subsection{Reception}
Reception is how the players experience a story. In \cite{understandingvg} they argue that: "a reception-theory based analysis can explain the way that narrative and gameplay together determine the player experience in games that make use of stories". We will not describe this theory any further here.. blabla.. 

\section{Gameplay}

In \cite{understandingvg} gameplay is defined as "the game dynamics emerging from the interplay between rules and game geography". The dynamics can be of different types. They can be entertaining or they can be predictable, or they can be none of those. In a video game, everything really depends on the gameplay. Gameplay defines how the game is played and is the most important element of a game. In short, gameplay can be describes as the interaction between the player and the game \cite{umlapproach}. Siang et al. describes two different kinds of interactions: player-object and object-object. When creating a game, a set of rules about what kind of interactions can be made have to be set. These rules are set by determining what kind of interactions are allowed between the two components: players and game objects. \cite{umlapproach} describes the player-token interactions with Figure \ref{fig:playertoken}, which is a description of gameplay, set aside the players experience.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{playertoken}
\caption[The player-token interaction]{The player-token interaction \cite{umlapproach}}
\label{fig:playertoken}
\end{center}
\end{figure} 
Different from objects is that tokens are conceptual (hva betyr det?), and may not have a one-to-one mapping with the programming language (skrevet rett av, vet ikke hvor viktig det er).
In a video game tokens is a thing that can react with something in a game. It can be defined three categories of different tokens: static, dynamic and behavioural. Static tokens has the same visual look throughout the whole game. Dynamic tokens, also called entities, can react to certain events in a game. Behavioural tokens are the parameters how they will react to the player and other tokens and are not physically represented in the game. Example is a game level manager which tells the player about high scores etc. The tokens can have attributes, which is representing the tokens state. Example of an attribute is the number of life. The tokens can also have behaviour, which say something about how the token can react in certain events \cite{umlapproach}.

\subsection{User Interface}
The interface is necessary to enable interaction between the player and the token. In \cite{umlapproach} Siang et al. present a figure describing the gameplay, see Figure \ref{fig:playerinterface}.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{playerinterface}
\caption[The revised player-token interaction]{The revised player-token interaction \cite{umlapproach}}
\label{fig:playerinterface}
\end{center}
\end{figure} 

The interface is where and what the player interacts with the game and includes the input that is sent through the input devices, like a game control, and the output the user receives on the screen and the speaker \cite{umlapproach}.

In this chapter we have discussed different aspects about video games. These are all important to understand and to consider when developing video games. In this assignment we will use this as a basis to describe a video game concept. Not every aspect will be described in detail, but we will.... skriver her hva vi egentlig skal gjøre..
