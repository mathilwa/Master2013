This chapter is about the two workshops we have conducted with participants from "Seniornett". We will present and describe how the workshops were set up and executed.
    
\section{Workshop no. 1}
The first workshop was held over a two day period, the 13th and 14th of March, with location at "Gulhuset, Voll g√•rd", a place familiar to the participants from "Seniornett". The workshop started around 2 pm and lasted approximately three hours. We had recruited 8 participants from "Seniornett" to our workshop, three males and five females. They were divided into two groups, one for each day. One of the recruited female had an accident, which made it difficult for her to participate in the workshop. We therefore ended up with 7 participants. The participants average age was 70.6 years with the youngest
