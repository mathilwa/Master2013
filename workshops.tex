\chapter{Workshops}
This chapter is about the two workshops we have conducted with participants from "Seniornett". We will present and describe how the workshops were set up and executed.
    
\section{Workshop no. 1}
The primary goal for our first workshop was to introduce the participants, from now on called informants, to the Xbox Kinect technology and to three commercial games. We  

The workshop was held over a two day period, the 13th and 14th of March, with location at "Gulhuset, Voll g√•rd", a place familiar to the participants from "Seniornett". The workshop started around 2 pm and lasted approximately three hours. We had recruited 8 participants from "Seniornett" to our workshop, three males and five females. They were divided into two groups, one for each day. One of the recruited female had an accident, which made it difficult for her to participate in the workshop. We therefore ended up with 7 participants. The participants average age was 70.6 years (with a standard deviation of 7,9 years). In addition to us and the participants, we had the first day two Ph.D. students with us who acted in the role of facilitators. The second day our supervisor, Lill Kristiansen, joined us and took the role of the facilitator.
